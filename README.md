# fumaroos
A pet raising simulation game for the 3DS. This is meant to be something of a 'clone' of tomagotchi v2. Will eventually support raising a pet into adulthood and then getting a new one. Maybe linking for breeding? Once a feature is supported, I will update this readme with a check mark next to it.

### Dependencies ###

### Gameplay ###

Your fumaroo is your own personal pet. You must raise it, being keen to keep care of its health! Food will help with hunger, but you'll also have to give it attention to keep it happy and buy toys to educate it! Once certain stat levels are reached, your fumaroo will be ready for the real world!
